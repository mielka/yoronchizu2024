## About This Repository

This repository contains the open-source code for the YoronChizu (Public Opinion Map) component of JAPAN CHOICE's 2024 House of Representatives election service. The code is released under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

## What is Mielka?

Mielka is a Japanese nonprofit organization founded in 2016. Led primarily by young people, it aims to enhance democracy in Japan by visualizing politics and making political information more accessible. The organization focuses on developing innovative tools that help citizens better understand and engage with the democratic process.

## What is JAPAN CHOICE?

JAPAN CHOICE is one of Japan's largest election information platforms, operated by Mielka since 2017. It provides comprehensive information about candidates, political parties, and policy issues during elections. During the 2021 House of Representatives election, JAPAN CHOICE served 1.6 million users, demonstrating its significant role in Japan's political landscape.

## What is the YoronChizu (Public Opinion Map)?

The YoronChizu (Public Opinion Map) is a service released on November 18, 2024, by Mielka. It was launched as an experimental feature of JAPAN CHOICE during the 2024 House of Representatives election. The service allows users to anonymously vote on specific issues extracted from party manifestos, and then visualizes the distribution of public opinions using advanced data analysis techniques.

Over about two weeks during the election period, 4,403 unique users participated in the YoronChizu. This repository provides both the source code and open access to that voting data.

## License Information

- **Source Code**: GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)
- **CSV files and images**: CC BY 4.0

The voting data collected from users is available as open data in the [yoronchizu2024-data](https://github.com/mielka/yoronchizu2024-data) repository.
For usage instructions of the data, please refer to [README.ipynb](https://github.com/mielka/yoronchizu2024-data/README.ipynb).

As of May 2025, although new votes are no longer being recorded, the Public Opinion Map remains accessible for exploration: [Public Opinion Map (Beta) - JAPAN CHOICE](https://japanchoice.jp/polis)

# Technical Details

The service uses _Polis_, a deliberation tool developed under the leadership of Colin Megill, on the server side. Polis gained recognition after its adoption in Taiwan's civic engagement project, vTaiwan.

The front end was redeveloped from scratch to suit Japan's context. Analysis of JAPAN CHOICE's user access revealed that 85% of the 3 million unique users accessed election information via mobile devices, necessitating optimization for small smartphone screens.

Additional features include:

- Visualization of political party stances using party icons
- AI-driven explanations of opinion clusters
- Rapid updates of user opinion position on the map

## Visualization of Political Party Stances Using Party Icons

The Public Opinion Map extracted voting issues directly from party manifestos. Each partyâ€™s stance â€”support, opposition, or neutralâ€” on each issue was encoded into data. This information was used to overlay political parties stances on the user opinion distribution scatterplot.

## AI-Driven Explanations of Opinion Clusters

Polis-generated clusters can be difficult for non-expert users to interpret. To address this, the data on "opinions characterizing clusters" generated by Polis was passed to an LLM, which provided a description of the opinions held by each group. It also summarized these descriptions into concise group names, which were displayed on the scatterplot.

## Rapid Updates of User Opinion Position on the Map

By embedding projection matrix information from PCA on the client side, user positions on the scatterplot could be computed without querying the server. This enabled real-time screen updates in response to user voting actions.

As a result, even though the Polis computation server is now inactive, the YoronChizu can still be experienced. This approach also allows the service to be demonstrated using the front end alone after the election period.

# Insights

## Unrepresented Opinion Groups

![](/images/keizai.png)

This figure visualizes opinion groups on economic policy. The lower-right cluster lacks party icons, indicating that this group's views are not well-represented by existing political parties. This suggests that public opinion in this group is not adequately reflected in national policy discussions. AI-generated analysis of this group is as follows:

> **Team Yellow: Skeptics on Price Pass-Through Measures**

> ðŸ¤– This group is relatively cautious about wage increases through measures supporting price pass-through for small businesses. They also oppose reductions or abolishment of consumption tax and are skeptical about providing subsidies to low-income households.

## Relationship Between Votes and Number of Clusters

Observations from previous Polis results raised concerns that opinion distributions might converge over time into two obvious opposing structures. This occurs when increasing data points lead PCA results to form an ellipsoid lacking clear boundaries, causing k-means clustering to split clusters along the first principal component axis.

However, in this experiment, even with 4,400 votes, four clusters remained distinct. The voting issues in this experiment were drawn from party manifestos, and no new issues were added during the voting period. This indicates that the convergence problem is more likely caused by the addition of voting issues and higher dimensionality, rather than increased user data.

Statistics were recorded hourly during the experiment. The chart below shows the relationship between the number of users and the number of clusters. It took approximately 2,500 users for the clusters to stabilize at four.

## Public Opinion on Digital Democracy in Japan

On digital democracyâ€”a topic underrepresented in party manifestosâ€”JAPAN CHOICE team set voting issues. To avoid problems caused by insufficient data, party icons were intentionally excluded from this map.

> **Team Green: Privacy Protection Advocates**

> ðŸ¤– This group values safeguarding individual control over personal information and strengthening privacy laws to European standards. They support regulating online advertising and democratic decision-making through participatory agenda-setting systems.

# Issues for Future Digital Democracy

The process of extracting unbiased opinions from party manifestos required careful human effort. While LLMs could assist in this process, their potential for hallucination poses significant risks, necessitating cautious experimentation. In tests with LLM-generated content on digital democracy, the output quality was deemed insufficient, and the feature was not utilized.

Concerns about hallucinated misinformation disadvantaging specific parties during the election led to the implementation of human reviews before publication. Updates were released three times during the election, sacrificing the real-time nature of Polis.

One challenge noted was that LLMs often misinterpreted clusters with complex opinion distributions. For instance, a cluster characterized by "70% support, 10% opposition within the cluster, but 90% support, 3% opposition outside" might be better described as "relatively higher opposition," yet LLMs tended to interpret this as "majority support." Further refinement in data representation for prompts is needed.

For similar reasons, user-submitted opinions were not accepted. While the ideal of [opening agenda-setting power to the people] remains desirable, real-time acceptance introduces challenges, including quality assurance, misinformation, and higher dimensionality with increased voting issues. Further research is required to address these challenges.
